Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find a collection of my blogs on various topics. Feel free to explore and share your thoughts!

## üìö Blog List

1. **[Not a CAG : Cached RAG with Amazon OpenSearch](https://medium.com/ai-adventure/not-a-cag-cached-rag-with-amazon-opensearch-13228c83a593)**  üÜï
   *This blog provides a clarification between a CAG and a cached RAG. It is a step by step guide to build your own Cached RAG using Amazon Opensearch using Amazon Sagemaker Studio Jupyter Notebook*

2. **[Build a Cache Augmented Generation(CAG) flow with Amazon Elasticache Valkey](https://medium.com/ai-adventure/build-a-cache-augmented-generation-cag-flow-with-amazon-elasticache-valkey-c80d7f9080cb)**  
   *A hands-on guide to building a CAG with Valkey cache on AWS*

3. **[Building a Custom Python Layer for AWS Lambda Using EC2 ‚Äî The Easy Way!](https://medium.com/@abhishekgautam_15881/building-a-custom-python-layer-for-aws-lambda-using-ec2-the-easy-way-f7af5d9fa22f)**
   *AWS Lambda makes serverless applications powerful, but when you need a specific Python version or custom libraries, things can get tricky. While Lambda Layers help, installing a new Python version on Amazon Linux 2 is not straightforward. Many developers struggle with missing dependencies, long build times, or compatibility issues.
In this guide, we‚Äôll simplify the process by using an EC2 instance to create a Lambda layer efficiently. This approach ensures compatibility with Amazon Linux 2 and saves time compared to manually setting up dependencies.*

4. **[Cache-Augmented Generation(CAG): The Game-Changing Alternative to Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://medium.com/ai-adventure/cache-augmented-generation-cag-the-game-changing-alternative-to-retrieval-augmented-generation-52ded85f7936)**  
   *Buckle up, NLP enthusiasts! The world of natural language processing is about to be rocked by a groundbreaking paradigm shift. Say hello to cache-augmented generation (CAG), the cool new kid on the block that‚Äôs giving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) a run for its money. In a recent research paper that‚Äôs got everyone buzzing, Brian J Chan, Chao-Ting Chen, Jui-Hung Cheng, and Hen-Hsen Huang introduce CAG, a cutting-edge approach that harnesses the power of long-context LLMs to tackle the challenges that have been plaguing RAG. Get ready to dive into the nitty-gritty of CAG and discover why it‚Äôs the hottest thing since sliced bread!*

5. **[Unlock the Generative AI Advantage: An AWS Roadmap for Business Leaders and Developers](https://medium.com/ai-adventure/unlock-the-generative-ai-advantage-an-aws-roadmap-for-business-leaders-and-developers-777b91b02ecd)**  
   *Generative AI (Gen AI) is no longer just a futuristic concept ‚Äî it‚Äôs rapidly becoming a business necessity. With applications ranging from customer service chatbots to groundbreaking medical research, Gen AI has the potential to add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy. Yet, while the opportunities are vast, many organizations are still figuring out how to integrate and scale this transformative technology effectively.*

6. **[Claude 3 Opus: A Leap in AI Excellence with My Personal Perspective](https://medium.com/@abhishekgautam_15881/claude-3-opus-a-leap-in-ai-excellence-with-my-personal-perspective-c4e30e865fda)**  
   *Artificial Intelligence has been transforming industries at a breathtaking pace, and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3 Opus has emerged as a shining example of this revolution. As someone who has worked with Large Language Models (LLMs) for over three years, I‚Äôve seen their potential evolve from mere text generators (BERT) to intelligent collaborators. What truly sets Opus apart is its ability to understand not just your requests but also your intent ‚Äî and often go beyond it. Let‚Äôs dive into what makes this model extraordinary, its benchmark performance, my use-case example, and suggestions on how you can use it effectively.*

7. **[Faiss, Lucene, or NMSLIB: Which one is best for your VectorDB?](https://medium.com/@abhishekgautam_15881/faiss-lucene-or-nmslib-which-one-is-best-for-your-vectordb-e73bd2ddcc95)**  
   *When dealing with Vector Databases (VectorDBs), choosing the right search and indexing algorithm is critical for performance and scalability. Three popular algorithms often considered for this task are Faiss, Lucene, and nmslib. In this blog, we‚Äôll break down what these algorithms are, their mathematical and conceptual underpinnings, and when to use each one, supported with examples.*
